This is project is a part of my Parallelism and Concurency Course, University of Zagreb, FER. It takes a ".pgm" image and filters it in various ways.

# Installation

Described in the final project documentation, it is not at all complicated.

# Usage

To filter a ".pgm" image, just run the executable you get after the installation and type in the right image name. Usage is also described in the final project documentation. The filtered image is stored in a file called "result.pgm".
